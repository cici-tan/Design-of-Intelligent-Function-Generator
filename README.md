# Design-of-Intelligent-Function-Generator
Accomplished a simple intelligent function producer, displaying different kinds of waves.

This generator can produce the incremental oblique wave, descending oblique wave, square wave, triangular wave, sine wave and step wave, also choosing excepted output wave by three buttons. 
In addition, it can be chosen to reset under a certain requirement. Similarly, Clock could be chosen different frequencies to change period of the wave.

We use EDA and Quartus II to design this generator.

EDA(electronic designing automation)technology is a new knowledge which under the software platform of EDA tool, depending on huge-functioned computers, use the large-scale programmable logic devices as the designing carrier to accomplish the design file by system described method- hardware described language; then through compilation, stimulation and final downloading into design carrier, completes the systematic circuit design.

Quartus II is integrated developed software of Altera Company. It supports schematic diagram, VHDL, VerilogHDL and AHDL(Altera Hardware Description Language), and other multiple-design-input forms, with its own synthesizer and emulator, could accomplishing the whole PLD design flow from design output to hardware configuration. Quartus II, as a programmable logic designing environment, is getting to be more and more welcome among digital system designers, especially due to its perfect user graphical interface designing method, strong design ability and audio-visual easy port.
